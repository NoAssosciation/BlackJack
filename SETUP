For setting up the game all you have to do is change the directories from 

cards_path = "C:\\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\Blackjack\\cards"
chips_path = "C:\\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\Blackjack\\chips"
save_file_path = "C:\\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\Blackjack\\save_data.txt"

to whatever your username is. 

ex: if your username is "Tim" it would be

cards_path = "C:\\Users\\Tim\\Downloads\\Blackjack\\cards"
chips_path = "C:\\Users\\Tim\\Downloads\\Blackjack\\chips"
save_file_path = "C:\\Users\\Tim\\Downloads\\Blackjack\\save_data.txt"
